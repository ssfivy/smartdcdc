##Description
The SmartDCDC is a combination telemetry power supply / precharge controller for Tritium's Wavesculptor 20 motor controller. It can also be used with the more modern WaveSculptor 22.

In early 2009, Sunswift upgraded the motor controller inside Sunswift III, before work started on Sunswift IV.
The old motor controller was the Tritium Gold controller, which is superseded by the Wavesculptor 20.
The new controller requires a precharge circuit, which uses two EV200 contactors from Tyco, each drawing a peak current of 3.8A.
This is too large for the old telemetry power supply (miniDCDC) to handle. 
Hence, we decided to build a new DC/DC converter which can supply enough current to power the contactors.
 
Early in the design we decide to design and implement a custom precharge circuit into the DC/DC that will only use one contactor, 
due to their weight and power draw. 
Due to the complexity of designing such circuit in analog, the smartDCDC uses a MSP430 microcontroller to control the precharge process.
This allows us to test the precharge algorithm and tweak the parameter values quite easily compared to an analog solution.
Note that the both the miniDCDC and Tritium's precharge circuit are completely analog.

Late in the design the CAN power is split into two separate lines with separate fuses. 
This should help in isolating potential accidents to one side of the CAN without affecting the other. 
Therefore it is recommended to put important components on one side and less important component on the other, with the smart dcdc in the middle.

##Features
* Microprocessor control & CAN interface
* Built-in Precharge circuit for Tritium WaveSculptor motor controller
* Complete electrical isolation between high (~100+V) and low voltage side (12V)
* 2x 12V General Purpose auxiliary output @ capable of delivering 12W.
* On/off control on all power ports: CAN, Aux1, Aux2
* On/off control on the DC/DC converter - requires external 12V source, either through CAN or aux.
* Partial backward compatibility with both Sunswift miniDCDC and Tritium precharge circuit
* 170V max operational voltage which should be enough for the wavesculptor
* Separate power fuses for both CAN connectors, so one side can short while unaffecting the other. Non isolated though.
* Fits in a pcb less than 13x13cm
